  <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
  <p>From the beginning, our vision has been for Coffee House 29 to collaborate with others to support the community and help those in need. Weâ€™ve been working behind the scenes to prepare a vehicle to allow us to do this on an ongoing basis: Itâ€™s called Project 29. Although there is more to come in the future, there are currently three ways you can join us in supporting worthwhile causes:</p>
  <li>Purchase MudLOVE bracelets and mugs. MudLOVE is a ceramics studio built on giving back. Every product you purchase provides 1 week of clean water to someone in need.

You can learn more about MudLOVE here:

  <li>Weâ€™ve sponsored a concealed carry class from Isborn Security Services. They are currently running a fundraiser for Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R), a fantastic organization fighting against human trafficking. You can learn more or donate online at the links below.

  <li>Pay It Forward to first responders. We have a designated fund/gift card you can donate to that will be swiped whenever a first responder comes in to purchase from us. Thank you first responders for all you do! Also, weâ€™ve created a link for all of you out there like me who want to pay it forward (aka donate) online! ðŸ¥³
